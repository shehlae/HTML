<h1>International Agreements</h1>
<p><strong>First International Agreement</strong></p>
<p>Basic concepts of international law such as treaties can be traced back thousands of years.<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/international-law">International Law</a> reflects the establishment and subsequent modification of a world system founded almost exclusively on the notion that independent sovereign states are the only relevant actors in the international system. The essential structure of international law was mapped out during the European Renaissance, though its origins lay deep in history and can be traced to cooperative agreements between peoples in the ancient Middle East. </p> 
<p>In addition, the study of <i>international law</i>, or public international law, is distinguished from the field of conflict of laws, or private international law, which is concerned with the rules of municipal law—as international lawyers term the domestic law of states—of different countries where foreign elements are involved.</p>
<span>International law is an independent system of law existing outside the legal orders of particular states. It differs from domestic legal systems in a number of respects. For example, although the <mark>United Nations General Assembly</mark>, which consists of representatives of some 190 countries, has the outward appearances of a legislature, it has no power to issue binding laws. </span>
<h2>Historical development</h2>
<p><strong>International law Structure</strong></p>
<span><b>International law</b> reflects the establishment and subsequent modification of a world system founded almost exclusively on the notion that independent sovereign states are the only relevant actors in the international system. The essential structure of international law was mapped out during the European Renaissance, though its origins lay deep in history and can be traced to cooperative agreements between peoples in the ancient Middle East.</span><br>
<span>Among the of these agreements were a treaty between the rulers of Lagash and Umma <i>(in the area of Mesopotamia)</i> in approximately <ins>2100 BCE</ins> <del>2200 BCE</del> and an agreement between the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II and Hattusilis III, the king of the Hittites, concluded in 1258 BCE.</span>
<p><strong>Nonstate actors in international law</strong></p>
<span>Historically, states were the only subjects of international law. During the 20th century, however, a growing body of international law was devoted to defining the rights and responsibilities of individuals. The rights of individuals under international law are detailed in various human rights instruments and agreements. </span> <br>
<span>Although references to the protection of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-rights">human rights</a> appear in the UN Charter, the principal engine of the process was <i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</i> <mark>(1948; UDHR)</mark>. The UDHR has been supplemented by an impressive range of international treaties, including the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979), the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1984), and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989). With the exception of the convention on genocide, these agreements also have established monitoring committees, which, depending on the terms of the particular agreement, may examine the regular reports required of states, issue general and state-specific comments, and entertain petitions from individuals.</span>
<p><strong>Defining human rights</strong></p>
<span>To say that there is widespread acceptance of the principle of human rights is not to say that there is complete agreement about the nature and scope of such rights or, indeed, their definition. Among the basic questions that have yet to receive conclusive answers are the following: whether human rights are to be viewed as divine, moral, or legal entitlements; whether they are to be validated by intuition, culture, custom, social contract, principles of distributive justice, or as prerequisites for happiness or the achievement of human dignity; whether they are to be understood as irrevocable or partially revocable; and whether they are to be broad or limited in number and content.</span><br>
<span>Even when the principle of human rights is accepted, there are controversies: whether human rights are a way of privileging narrowly conceived special interests over the common interest; whether they are the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Politics-American-magazine">politics</a> of predominantly progressive elites; whether they are a stalking horse for Western economic imperialism; and so forth. It is thus sometimes claimed that there exists no universally agreed upon theory or even understanding of human rights.</span><br>
<p>Despite this lack of consensus, a number of widely accepted (and interrelated) postulates can assist in the task of defining human rights. Five in particular stand out, though not even these are without controversy.</p>
<span>First, regardless of their ultimate origin or <mark>justification</mark>, human rights are understood to represent both individual and group demands for <i>political power, wealth, enlightenment, and other cherished values or capabilities</i>, the most fundamental of which is respect and its constituent elements of reciprocal tolerance and mutual forbearance in the pursuit of all other such values or capabilities. Consequently, human rights imply both claims against persons and institutions impeding the realization of these values or capabilities and standards for judging the legitimacy of laws and traditions. At bottom, human rights qualify state sovereignty and power, sometimes expanding the latter even while circumscribing the former</span>
<p id="States in international law" >States in international law</p>
<span>Although states are not the only entities with international legal standing and are not the exclusive international actors, they are the primary subjects of international law and possess the greatest range of rights and obligations. Unlike states, which possess rights and obligations automatically, international organizations, individuals, and others derive their rights and duties in international law directly from particular instruments. </span><br>
<span>Individuals may, for example, assert their rights under international law under the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which entered into force in 1976.</span>
<p><strong>International human rights: prescription and enforcement</strong></p>
<span>Ever since ancient times, but especially since the emergence of the modern state system, the Age of Discovery, and the accompanying spread of industrialization and European culture throughout the world, there has developed, for economic and other reasons, a unique set of customs and conventions regarding the humane treatment of foreigners.</span><br>
<span><i>This evolving International Law of State Responsibility</i> for Injuries to Aliens, as these customs and conventions came to be called, represents the beginning of active concern—however much they served the interests of colonial expansion—for human rights on the international plane. The founding fathers of international law—particularly Francisco de Vitoria, Grotius, and Emmerich de Vattel—were quick to observe that all persons, outlander as well as the Other, were entitled to certain natural rights, and they emphasized, consequently, the importance of according aliens fair treatment.</span>
